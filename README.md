## ðŸš€ Get started

To use the 1Password Go SDK in your project:

1. [Create a service account](https://my.1password.com/developer-tools/infrastructure-secrets/serviceaccount/) and give it the appropriate permissions in the vaults where the items you want to use with the SDK are saved.
2. Provision your service account token. We recommend provisioning your token from the environment. For example, to export your token to the `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable:

   **macOS or Linux**

   ```bash
   export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your-service-account-token>
   ```

   **Windows**

   ```powershell
   $Env:OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN = "<your-service-account-token>"
   ```

3. Install the 1Password Go SDK in your project:

   ```bash
   go get github.com/1password/onepassword-sdk-go
   ```

4. Use the Go SDK in your project:

```go
import (
    "context"
    "os"

    "github.com/1password/onepassword-sdk-go"
)

func main() {
    token := os.Getenv("OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN")

    client, err := onepassword.NewClient(
                context.TODO(),
                onepassword.WithServiceAccountToken(token),
                // TODO: Set the following to your own integration name and version.
                onepassword.WithIntegrationInfo("My 1Password Integration", "v1.0.0"),
    )
    if err != nil {
	// handle err
    }
    secret, err := client.Secrets.Resolve(context.TODO(), "op://vault/item/field")
    if err != nil {
        // handle err
    }
    // do something with the secret
}
```

Make sure to use [secret reference URIs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secret-reference-syntax/) with the syntax `op://vault/item/field` to securely load secrets from 1Password into your code.

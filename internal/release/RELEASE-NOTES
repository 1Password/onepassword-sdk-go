## NEW

- **File Support:** You can now create Document items, attach files to items, delete files from items, and read file contents using the SDK.

## IMPROVED

- **Read files using secret references**: You can now resolve secret references that point to files attached to 1Password items.

- **Support for more item field types**: You can now create, retrieve, and edit items containing SSH keys, Month-Year and Menu-type fields using the SDK.
- **Read more field types using secret references**: You can now resolve secret references that point to information stored in Date, Month/Year, Address, and Reference field types.
- **Improved error messages**: The error messages returned by the SDK were improved to be more clear and actionable.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE ⚠️

This release contains a breaking change for the Go SDK, where the attributes of `client` (`Vaults`, `Items`, `Secrets`), as well as the `Shares` attribute of `client.Items` should now be accessed through getter methods instead of directly.

This does **not** affect ****any code already deployed, and will not take effect in your code-base before explicitly updating to the latest version of the 1Password Go SDK (0.2.0).

To migrate your code which uses prior versions of the 1Password Go SDK to the latest, replace in your application code all occurrences of:

- `client.Items.Shares.` with `client.Items().Shares().`
- `client.Items.`  with `client.Items().`
- `client.Vaults.` with `client.Vaults().`
- `client.Secrets.` with `client.Secrets().`

in the SDK function calls.

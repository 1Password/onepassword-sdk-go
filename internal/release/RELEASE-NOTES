The v0.1.2 release of the Go SDK brings:
* Support for item tags. You can now create, get, and edit tags within your 1Password items using item CRUD functions.
* Support for fetching one-time password codes using secret references. You can now fetch your TOTP code with the `Secrets.Resolve` function, using a secret reference for the TOTP field in your item. For example: "op://vault/item/field?=attribute=totp"
* Support for validating secret references. You can now check that a secret reference is formatted correctly without having to resolve it or even authenticate, using the 'ValidateSecretReference' function.

1Password Go SDK v0.1.6

NEW:
* 		Support for item sharing: You can now create an item sharing link via the 1Password SDKs using the new client.Items.Shares API.
* 		Support for item archiving: You can now move items to the archive with the SDKs, using the new client.Items.Archive(vault_uuid, item_uuid) function.

IMPROVED:
* 		Support for item notes: You can now read, create and edit items with a notes field, accessing it via item.notes.
* 		Support for SSH key attributes in secret references: You can now retrieve an SSH key's public key, key type and fingerprint with client.secrets.resolve.
* 		Support for additional field types: You can now read, create and edit items with Email (email addresses) and Reference (ID references to other 1Password items) type fields.

BUGS:
* 		Fix item CRUD flow for the Password item category: Creating or editing a Password item no longer leads to a panic in the Go SDK.
* 		Improved field matching logic for secret references: Retrieving a field from the item's default field section is now possible even if there is an identically named field in one of the item's named sections.
